# Disease_Burden_Prediction

This project aims to predict the Global Disease Burden from 1990 - 2019, and estimated the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors for 204 countries and territories and selected subnational locations by vizualization and plotting.It uses various techniques of Sklearn for Regression tasks - Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree.

The following are the R2 scores for the models:
1. Linear Regression : 0.9153637346329239
2. Decision Tree : 0.981766595091578
3. Random Forest : 0.9943707298564589

This shows that Random forest gave the best result with an R2 of 0.9943707298564589.
